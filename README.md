Image Steganography with LSB Algorithm
======================================

Overview
--------

Image Steganography is a technique used to hide secret data within digital images without visibly altering the image's appearance to the human eye. The LSB (Least Significant Bit) algorithm is a simple and widely used method for this purpose. It works by replacing the least significant bit of each color channel in the image with a bit of the secret data, making it difficult to perceive any visible changes in the image.

Encoding (Hiding the Secret Data)
---------------------------------

1.  Convert Secret Data into Binary Format: The secret message is first converted into binary form, representing each character using 8 bits.

2.  Select an Image for Steganography: Choose a cover image that will hold the secret data. This image should be large enough to accommodate the secret message.

3.  Loop Through the Pixels of the Image: Starting from the top-left corner, iterate through the pixels of the image.

4.  Modify the Least Significant Bit of Each Color Channel: For each pixel, modify the least significant bit of the red, green, and blue color channels with the corresponding bit from the binary representation of the secret message.

5.  Terminate the Message: To ensure we can extract the hidden message later, we add a termination delimiter to the binary message (e.g., "00000000"). This delimiter helps us identify the end of the hidden data when decoding.

6.  Save the Modified Image: The image with the hidden message is saved, which appears the same as the original image but contains the secret data.

Decoding (Extracting the Secret Data)
-------------------------------------

1.  Select the Encoded Image: Choose the image that contains the hidden data (the output from the encoding step).

2.  Loop Through the Pixels of the Image: Iterate through the pixels of the image, similar to the encoding step.

3.  Extract the Least Significant Bit of Each Color Channel: For each pixel, extract the least significant bit of the red, green, and blue color channels.

4.  Combine the Bits to Form Binary Data: Combine the extracted bits to form the binary representation of the hidden message.

5.  Find the Termination Delimiter: Locate the termination delimiter ("00000000") in the binary message to determine the end of the hidden data.

6.  Convert the Binary Data to the Original Message: Remove the termination delimiter and convert the binary data back into the original secret message.

Capacity and Security
---------------------

The capacity of LSB steganography depends on the size of the cover image and the amount of hidden data. If the hidden data exceeds the capacity of the cover image, the secret message will not be completely hidden and may become visible or lost during the process.

While LSB steganography is a simple method, it may not be highly secure against sophisticated attacks or specific image manipulations. Therefore, for more secure applications, more advanced steganography techniques and encryption methods are used.

Disclaimer
----------

Steganography should be used responsibly and ethically. Unauthorized use of steganography techniques to hide sensitive or harmful information in images can be illegal and unethical. Always respect privacy laws and regulations while using steganography tools.
